# This molecule configuration file is suitable for testing Ansible
# roles that _do not_ require SystemD.  If your Ansible role _does_
# require SystemD then you should use molecule-with-systemd.yml
# instead.
#
# Note that the molecule configuration file that is symlinked to
# molecule.yml is the one that will be used.
